Todo:
  
  ✔ You have several places where the word "I" is not uppercase. It should always be uppercase. @done(19-09-03 16:34)
  ✔ External links (github, linkedin, email, projects) should open in a new tab. This is partially industry standard and partially because after the recruiter looks at those links you want them to end up back on your site. @done(19-09-03 16:42)
  ☐ About me needs to have some padding: https://cl.ly/361955c69b53
  ☐ Project description gets very narrow on mobile. A bit of margin is good, but you should use media queries so that it looks proportional on different screen sizes.
  ✔ "assets" folder is misspelled in your repo. @done(19-09-03 16:51)
  ☐ Projects h2 should be inside the section HTML to be semantic.
  ☐ About me section should have an h2 so we know what this section is about (and to make it easier for people with screen readers to know what it is about).
  ☐ Should use main tag for semantic purposes (footer just should be below it).
  ☐ This sentence needs some punctuation. It reads like it should be three separate sentences, but there are no periods in it: "I like building random projects I enjoy solving problems with code and making life easier, I enjoy learning new technologies and frameworks so the user experience is enjoyable"
