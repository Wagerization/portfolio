  ✔ About me should talk about wanting to work on a team of great programers. @started(19-08-31 22:15) @done(19-08-31 22:20) @lasted(5m45s)
  
  ✔ Projects section needs to include a title and description for each project. @done(19-08-31 22:41)
 
  ✔ Screenshot for project needs to be compelling: https://cl.ly/832e55e35784. The font is so small in the screenshot that I can't read it, which makes it not compelling. @done(19-08-31 23:04)
 
  ✔ External links (github, linkedin, email, projects) should open in a new tab. This is partially industry standard and partially because after the recruiter looks at those links you want them to end up back on your site. @done(19-08-31 22:27)
 
  ✔ Contact section must include linkedin. @done(19-08-31 22:27)
 
  ✔ Large bodies of text should be left aligned, as it is difficult for the eye to read more than 1-2 lines of center aligned text. This is especially important on mobile where content takes up more lines: https://cl.ly/cf74abad444b @done(19-08-31 22:29)
 
  ✔ Black text on purple lacks contrast and would make it hard for a visually impaired user to use your site. You can use this contrast checker to see what colors would be good: Contrast Checker @done(19-08-31 23:01)
 
  ✔ Semantically, your text inside the header should be an h1 instead of a p since this is the title of your page. @done(19-08-31 23:00)
 
  ✔ footer should not be in main section since footer semantically is something that would appear on every page of your app if it had multiple pages. @done(19-08-31 22:13)
 
  ✔ Each section should have a header (h2-h6). For projects, that can just mean moving the p with "Projects" text inside the section and making it a header. For about me, the "About me" text feels like the header for the section and the "Hi, I'm Adam..." the header for the page, but it is up to you how you think this should be. @done(19-08-31 22:43)
 
  ✔ "Contact Info" should not be an h1 as this is not the title of your page. @done(19-08-31 22:43)
 
  ✔ Site needs to be mobile first. This means that your default CSS is for mobile and you use media queries to adjust the page as it gets larger. In practice, this means that all of your media queries should be min-width instead of max-width @done(19-08-31 22:55)
